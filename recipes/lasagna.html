    <h1><em>The Best Lasagna</em></h1>
    <p>
        This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly!
        This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <strong>For the meat sauce:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced
            1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce
            3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)
            1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
            2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>To Assemble Lasagna:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><h4><strong><em>Put pasta water on to boil</em></strong></h4></p>
            <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><h4><strong><em>Brown the ground beef</em></strong></h4></p>
            <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
                Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><h4><strong><em>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</em></strong></h4></p>
            <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
                Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
